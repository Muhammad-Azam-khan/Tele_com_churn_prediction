# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to assist telecom companies in reducing customer churn by leveraging machine learning techniques. The primary objectives are to understand the factors influencing customer churn, predict churn risk scores, and develop targeted retention strategies. Additionally, a "CHURN-FLAG" is introduced to identify customers at high risk of churning.

## Problem Statement

1. Identify key factors driving customer churn.
2. Develop churn risk scores to guide customer retention campaigns.
3. Predict churn using a newly created variable, "CHURN-FLAG."

## Domain Analysis

The following features are used for customer churn prediction:

1. **State**: Geographic location of the customer.
2. **Account Length**: Duration of the customer's subscription.
3. **Area Code**: Customer's phone area code.
4. **Phone**: Unique identifier for the customer.
5. **International Plan**: Whether the customer has subscribed to international calling.
6. **VMail Plan**: Subscription status of the voicemail plan.
7. **Day Mins**: Total minutes of daytime usage.
8. **Day Calls**: Number of daytime calls made.
9. **Day Charge**: Charges incurred for daytime usage.
10. **Eve Mins**: Total evening usage minutes.
11. **Eve Calls**: Number of evening calls made.
12. **Eve Charge**: Charges for evening usage.
13. **Night Mins**: Total nighttime usage.
14. **Night Calls**: Number of nighttime calls made.
15. **Night Charge**: Charges incurred for nighttime usage.
16. **International Mins**: Minutes spent on international calls.
17. **International Calls**: Number of international calls made.
18. **International Charge**: Charges for international calls.
19. **CustServ Calls**: Number of customer service calls made.
20. **Churn**: Binary indicator (YES/NO) for customer churn.

## Data Insights

- **Usage vs Charges**: Strong correlation between usage (minutes) and corresponding charges.
- **Churn Prediction**: Analysis shows that voicemail usage may slightly reduce churn likelihood.
- **International Plans**: A majority (90%) of customers do not have international plans, suggesting less relevance to churn.
- **Customer Service**: 37% of customers made no customer service calls, potentially reflecting higher satisfaction levels.

## Key Features and Algorithms

- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - SVC, KNeighborsClassifier
  - XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
  - Neural Networks (MLP)
  - Naive Bayes (Multinomial, Bernoulli)
  - Ensemble Voting Classifier

- **Resampling Technique**: SMOTE was used to handle class imbalance in the churn dataset.

## Insights

1. **Strong Relationship Between Usage and Charges**: High correlation between usage minutes and corresponding charges.
2. **Voicemail and Churn**: Customers with voicemail usage are slightly less likely to churn.
3. **International Calls**: Few customers use international plans, impacting churn minimally.
4. **Churn Correlations**: Various usage patterns and call features are explored to predict churn.

## Business Decisions

1. **Usage-Based Pricing Plans**: Based on usage and charges, offering flexible pricing plans to match customer needs.
2. **Retention Campaigns**: Target customers with high voicemail usage for retention.
3. **Churn Prevention**: Use churn risk scores to prioritize customer support efforts.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model training and evaluation scripts:

   ```bash
   python churn_prediction.py
   ```

## Conclusion

This project helps identify factors contributing to customer churn and provides actionable insights to telecom companies for customer retention. By focusing on usage patterns and churn prediction, the company can develop better customer-centric strategies.
